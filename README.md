In this project I build an API unsing node/express and sharp module that is changing the size of an image, based on given parameters.

Scripts:

- npm run test -> for tests
- node build/index.js -> for starting a server

URL code to access the endpoint:
http://localhost:3000/api/image?filename=beach&width=200&height=200
